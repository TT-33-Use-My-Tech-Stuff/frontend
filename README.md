# QUICK NOTE ON STYLING

You'll see that every HTML element added starts real tiny - I've already applied a CSS reset to App.CSS in order to apply it across our app, this implements a font-size which changes the root font-size to a responsive 10px - add your styles to the CSS document or use Styled Components to size things to your liking.

This will allow you to size EVERYTHING with 'rem' if you like, keeping it all responsive. 

EXAMPLE: 2.4rem === 24px... but responsive!
